File Descriptions:

lab3a.c: This file contains the actual C program. It takes in an image file and scans
the super block, group descriptors, block bitmap, inode bitmap, inode, and directory
entries. Then it outputs csv's based on the filesystem's contents.

Makefile: This file gives instructions to the make command on how to compile the code. It
also removes the files that it creates (namely the executables and the zipped file). It 
also will generate a new tarball containing the Makefile, source code, README, 
compressing all the necessary files. 

README: This file contains all the information about the program as well as my
personal information.

ext2_fs.h: This file was provided and it contains all the structs we need for reading
the image. This includes structs like the super block struct. It also contains constants
like EXT2_N_BLOCKS.

I watched this YouTube video to get a better understanding of what file systems are
and then get a closer look at the organization in an ext2 file system. I was confused on 
the difference between blocks and block groups, and how the inode bitmap worked.
This video helped me understand the high level structure better and how the different
pieces of data are mapped out.

I referenced this extensively as it had everything about the struct information and
what kind of information each of the fields held. This was like my Bible for the lab.

http://www.science.smith.edu/~nhowe/262/oldlabs/ext2.html
This was my second Bible for this lab. It had helpful examples of what information
we can glean from the superblock part and I used some of the example code for formatting
my print statements. The examples and paragraphs helped me understand how to parse the
information from the image file.

I referenced these for the syntax and how to use gmtime to convert the time to GMT
and how to use the strftime to easily wrie the date and time to string.

I referenced all 3 TA's slides.
