File Descriptions:

lab4b.c: This file is the actual source code for the project and it uses API's to connect to the
Beaglebone and read the temperature from a temperature sensor. It also polls for a button to
see when the user wants to terminate the program.

check.sh: This is a bash script that is invoked by "make check". It runs some simple test cases
on lab4b such as checking that bogus arguments are invalid, if valid arguments will result in the
correct return value, and that it logs commands correctly.

Makefile: This file compiles all the source code, Makefile, and README into a compressed tar file.

README: This file contains my beaglebone serial number as well as my personal information.

Beaglebone serial number: BBGW17100610

I was trying to see if there was a way to splice strings in C like in Python and I found this article. I needed
a way to compare only part of the strings in the command to check what the command was. I learned about
the function strncmp from the stack overflow post and then referenced the 2nd website for syntax and usage.

I needed to print formatted strings to the file for the time so I looked at the documentation for fprint
to see how to do it.

I looked at the documentation for mraa functions to check syntax and return values.

I referenced all 3 TA's slides.
