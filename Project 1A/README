File Descriptions:

lab1a.c: This file contains the actual C program. The program simulates a terminal 
when the --shell option is specified. The program forks a child (shell that runs commands)
and then the parent program (terminal) redirects input from the keyboard through a pipe
to the child, which then executes it and sends the output back to the parent to display.

Makefile: This file gives instructions to the make command on how to compile the code. It
also removes the files that it creates. It also will generate a new tarball containing, 
compressing all the necessary files. 

README: This file contains all the information about the program as well as my
personal information.

I used this source to test out what non-canonical, no echo input looked like.

I watched this YouTube video to get a better, visual understanding of how pipes
work for communication and why we use them.

I watched this video to get an overview of how fork() works in creating new
processes.

I also referenced all 3 TA's slides.
