File Descriptions:

lab4c_tcp.c: This file is the actual source code for the project and it uses API's to connect the
Beaglebone to a server. The Beaglebone periodically reads the temperature from a sensor and sends
the information to the server. It also polls for input from the server and executes commands accordingly.
This is all done without encrypting the information being passed back and forth.

lab4c_tls.c: This file is the actual source code for the project and it uses API's to connect the
Beaglebone to a server. It performs the same function as lab4c_tcp.c, however, this uses OpenSSL
libraries to encrypt the data being passed back and forth. 

Makefile: This file compiles all the source code, Makefile, and README into a compressed tar file.

README: This file contains my beaglebone serial number as well as my personal information.

Beaglebone serial number: BBGW17100610

I tried to use fprintf to send the formatted strings to a file descriptor, however, I didn't realize that
fprintf accepts pointers of FILE type only. So I read this post and found that there's a function called
dprintf that will function similarly to fprintf but accepts file descriptors.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18079340/using-getopt-in-c-with-non-option-arguments
I wasn't sure how to use getopt_long to process arguments without -- in front so I read this post.
It turns out that getopt_long preprocesses argv and moves the ones without -- to the end. Based on this,
I still kept the switch case implementation to process the arguments with -- and then did a separate check
outside of the switch case for the port number.

I didn't know how to print a formatted string to a buffer and I found sprintf. I followed the syntax on this
site for reference.

I referenced all 3 TA's slides.
