File Descriptions:

lab0.c: This file contains the actual C program to read from stdin and write to stdout. 

Makefile: This file gives instructions to the make command on how to compile the code. It
also can clean up the contents by removing the files that it creates and the tar file. It
also will generate a new tarball containing all the necessary files. Lastly, it can test
the script to make sure that the basic functionalities work. 

README: This file contains all the information about the short program as well as my
personal information.

backtrace.png: This is an image of when I ran the program through gdb to see what the stack 
looked like after a segmentation fault.

breakpoint.png: This is an image of when I ran the program through gdb to check the segmentation
fault. I tried to dereference a NULL pointer and the picture shows that the pointer contains 0x0
which is NULL and thus it can't be dereferenced.

Smoke Test Case Descriptions:

# unrecognized arguments: check that program exits with status 1 when invoked with bad arguments
# input existing file: check that program exists with status 0 with correct input and output files (output file is created)
# input nonexistant file: check that program exits with status 2 when input file does not exist
# test input file without read permissions: check that program exist with status 2 when the input cannot be opened
# output file without read permissions: check that program exits with status 3 when the output file cannot be accessed
# overwrite existing file: check that program exits with status 0 and overwrites an output file that contained bytes
# catch: check that program exits with status 3 upon catching the segfault error with the SIGSEGV handler
# segfault: check that the program exits with status 139 and that stdin is not copied to stdout
# input with invalid file and segfault: check that program exits with status 2 and throws an input error

I used this source to better understand how the API getopt_long works. It showed lots of examples 
of how to use it and explained the API's arguments and how to use them.

I referenced the syntax on this post to figure out how to write bash script in the Makefile
for the smoke tests.
