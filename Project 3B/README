File Descriptions:

lab3b.py: This file contains the python code to parse csv files and determine if the
filesystem is corrupted or not. It reads the data line by line and saves the information
into structs. Then it has 3 functions that parse the data and determine if the blocks,
inodes, or directories have any inconsistencies.

Makefile: This file gives instructions to the make command on how to compile the code. It
also removes the files that it creates (namely the executables and the zipped file). It 
also will generate a new tarball containing the Makefile, source code, and README. It
creates a hardlink between the python code and the executable name lab3b.

README: This file contains all the information about the program as well as my
personal information.

I used this in supplement to documentation on the sys module because I wasn't sure
how to report to stderr.

I used these to brush up on how to use the csv library as I had never used it before.
I referenced the example code on how to open and parse the rows of a csv. It was very
convenient to be able to extract the values from the row exactly like an array.

I referenced all 3 TA's slides.
